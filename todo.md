# todo
- textures
- model loading (KIND OF DONE?)
- shader struct
- create better tools for generating raw model data
- implement compression for textures
- create proper destructors for classes
- move uniform implementation from renderer to shader

# small stuffs
- camera movement should be multiplied by delta_time
- redo keyboard input to take scancode
- implement some sort of caching when calculating view matrix, no need to calc it every time
- fix code duplication in loaders for mesh and texture
- Make shader error handling rust-like
