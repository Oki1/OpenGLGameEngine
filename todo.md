# todo
- textures
- model loading (KIND OF DONE?)
- shader struct
- create better tools for generating raw model data

# small stuffs
- camera movement should be multiplied by delta_time
- redo keyboard input to take scancode
- implement some sort of caching when calculating view matrix, no need to calc it every time
